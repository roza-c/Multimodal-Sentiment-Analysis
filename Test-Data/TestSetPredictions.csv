Charlotte33,"The world hast just seen its hottest February in history, breaking records for nine months in a row. Ocean temperatures are off the charts. I’m currently spending time in Spain, which is experiencing its worst drought in decades, drying up reservoirs (see photos) and forcing entire regions into emergency measures to prevent cities from running out of water. I don’t want to gloss over these realities. While I’m lucky to spend time in some of the most beautiful areas of Europe, I’m reminded daily of the impacts of the climate crisis and biodiversity decline. There are very few places left intact. I allow a space in my heart to be ravaged by grief, and then channel these difficult feelings into action. Into hope. What keeps me going these days is seeing the many incredible people working tirelessly to tackle these issues. To build a better future. I’ve spent the last few days filming a project led by a community which is working on restoring the water table of an entire valley. There are millions of people out there doing the impossible and shaping new realities. Shaping new futures. And that vision is what I’m holding onto. You can learn more about this and other stories of hope via @earthly.explore. Stay soft. Don’t grow numb to what’s happening in the world.

Charlotte35,"This is 11 year old Salwa heading into surgery at our hospital in Gaza. The medical team showered her with balloons to help her relax and overcome her fear going in to surgery. The team are particularly protective of Salwa as she was the victim of an Israeli airstrike that not only injured her foot, but tragically killed most members of her family, including both her parents. Mohammad Wadi, our Operating Theatre supervisor explains “I remember when Salwa arrived, a few days after the airstrike. It was very sad for all the team. I cried when I left the hospital. We have been taking care of Salwa like she was our daughter since then. We want to make this experience more bearable for her."" Israeli authorities admitted that a faulty assessment led to the attack that killed nine members of Salwa’s family: her parents, her brothers, her aunt, her uncle and her cousins. The families used to live in shacks built with corrugated metal sheets, some 15 kilometres south of Gaza City, where they raised livestock. Nothing remains of their homes.

Growing up hearing sirens, hiding in shelters, losing your loved ones, how can one ever overcome this trauma? I hate to know that not only Russia has taken lives of some many Ukrainians in the literal sense but also has taken the lives they were supposed to have and the future of the young generation of Ukrainians.

Roza33,"Earthstar mushrooms, what even are they? We mean, they’re not like a “regular” mushroom, but a “cool” mushroom. It’s like they’re saying, ‘Oh, you thought you knew mushrooms? Well, hold my spores!’ Earthstars belong to a group called Gasteromycetes, or “stomach fungi”. Their fruiting bodies are a stomach-shaped sac filled with dry spores. Native to Earth, the earthstar begins as a pod, or bud, and bursts open (“blooms”) as it ages. Tastefully. As it opens, it forms a starlike pattern, hence, its name. It’s all coming together! Another aspect that contributes to the opening is water. The “petals” close in on themselves as they begin to dry out, but opens like a flower when the fungus is hydrated again. It’s got a whole ‘ta-da!’ moment when it opens, revealing its spore-filled center. It’s like a mushroom that’s been invited to the fungal Oscars and decided to show up in a fabulous gown made of dirt and leaves. Who are you wearing? Umm, it’s House of Gasteromycetes. Finally, can you eat it? (You were thinking it.) While it is not considered toxic, they are considered to be inedible due to their hard, fibrous nature and bitter taste. I can’t believe you’re still bitter? It is.

Roza44,"LITTLE RASCALS NABBED FOR HOUSTON BANK ROBBERY. In Houston, Texas, the FBI has confirmed the apprehension of three bank robbery suspects known as the “little rascals.” Their capture follows a widely publicized incident involving the alleged robbery of a Wells Fargo bank in the Greenspoint area. Initially believed to be between 14 and 18 years old based on witness accounts, the FBI later revealed their ages as 16, 12, and 11 years old. The case falls under the jurisdiction of the Harris County Sheriff’s Office (HCSO), who reported that the boys passed a threatening note to a teller, purportedly armed but without displaying a weapon, and fled with an undisclosed sum of money. Following the release of surveillance photos, public tips poured in, leading to the identification of two of the boys by their parents and the third through law enforcement channels after an altercation. Authorities also recovered a weapon and a distinctive item seen in one of the photos. The trio, dubbed the “little rascals,” faces charges of robbery by threat, classified as a second-degree felony. Speculation arose regarding potential adult involvement, given the apparent lack of sophistication in the crime. However, details on any accomplices or recovered funds remain undisclosed by investigators. While the FBI refrains from releasing their names or further details, legal experts speculate on potential consequences if proven guilty. They could face probation until 18 or juvenile detention until 19, with slim chances of the 16-year-old being tried as an adult, according to a criminal defense attorney. #houston #littlerascals #minor #bankrobbers",0,0,[0.9540379  0.00843433 0.03752782],0.0,"[0.6138460040092468, 0.3549042344093323, 0.03124973736703396]"

Roza53,"Yesterday we said goodbye to Alexei Navalny. His funeral was an incredibly difficult and emotional experience. And yet there was love and hope. Thousands of brave Russians came out to say farewell to Alexei despite the risk of arrest. The ceremony in the church lasted for around 20 minutes and continued in the cemetery where Alexei was buried to Frank Sinatra’s “My Way” and music from “Terminator 2.” The police presence was heavy, but the ceremony was carried out peacefully. The police did rush the ceremony so only a few hundred people were allowed in the church and there was also limited space at the burial. Alexei's supporters bravely chanted ""Putin is a killer,"" ""Navalny,"" ""No war,"" ""Yulia, we are with you,"" ""Russia Will Be Free"" etc. It was very touching to see Alexei's parents, Anatoly & Lydmila, sitting with Yulia's mom in the front row at the church. Yulia's mother represented her daughter and grandchildren who cannot enter the country. The public thanked Alexei's mom for raising an amazing son. A touching moment occurred when Yulia's mom said a few words. She thanked everyone for coming and said beautiful words about Alexei who she has known for over 25 years. She praised the strong and rare love between her daughter and Alexei. She mentioned that Yulia had called her 10 times during the day, asking her to pass a message to Alexei that she “loves him immeasurably.” Yulia’s mom highlighted how strong both her daughter and Lyudmila Navalnaya are, and that the two women have a great relationship. They were constantly connected with each other over the past 3 years, and fought for Alexei together. Yulia’s mom asked the press and propagandists to stop spreading lies and disinformation about her daughter. It’s obvious that Yulia and Alexei have an unbreakable bond. Their love is not only stronger than fear, it is also stronger than death. Although Yulia and the children could not physically be at the funeral, their loving presence was felt. Yesterday we said farewell a true hero of our time. @navalny #алексейнавальный #юлиянавальная #alexeinavalny #yulianavalnaya #alexeynavalny #nowar #prayforukraine #нетвойне #navalny #навальный",0,2,[1.3756523e-03 8.9742430e-04 9.9772698e-01],2.0,"[0.032910097390413284, 0.027812877669930458, 0.9392770528793335]"

Roza55,"Haven't shared this publicly until now, but last month, I was in a near-fatal car wreck. The first person to check on me after the accident said I was completely dazed and didn't respond to her repeatedly calling to me. I remember seeing someone, but all I remember hearing was dead silence and eventually a soft buzzing, before the smoke from the airbags finally brought me back to reality. Police officers on the scene told me my seatbelt saved my life – no way I survive if I wasn't wearing it. I ended up with injuries to my legs, collarbone, rib cage, two partially collapsed lungs, internal bruising, and some post-concussive issues. Doctors say many of the injuries were caused by my seatbelt. But I can live with that. Literally. Because I walked out of my car. Yes, I was jammed in, yes it hurt to move, but I *walked* out of that vehicle you see in the photos. And I've recovered well. A mentor recently challenged me to become more intentional in how I live life. I’ve always prided myself living with intention and, admittedly, I probably do more than most people. But there are certain areas that I go hands off and coast. Sometimes out of ease, sometimes out of fear. I don’t think it’s a mistake that this accident occurred just shortly after that conversation. It’s led to a lot of wrestling. Thinking about who and what carries meaning in my life and what I need to do with that.I imagine I'll be wrestling with that for a while, but two things I know for sure: 1.God is good. Always. I’m so frustrated that I’m dealing with post-concussive issues yet again. But, I don’t doubt the goodness of God through this entire situation. 2. Wear your seatbelt. Always.
